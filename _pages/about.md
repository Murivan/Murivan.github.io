In January 2024 I joined KreativInstitut.OWL.

My primary interest in research lies within the field of in Sound and Music Computing.
I am particularly particularly interested in applications of 3D audio, recording and reproduction techniques, with a specific interest for binaural spatialization. During my PhD program I focused my research on the implementation of real-time spatialization systems combined with head-tracking techniques in order to render an environment coherently with the position of the listener. I also used GPGPU (General Purpose computing on Graphic Processing Units) capabilities to implement a convolution engine on GPU.
I am also interested in psychoacoustics and in understanding the perception of 3D audio. I carried out research for hearing aids and I cooperated in a study for assessing tinnitus in the normal-hearing population.

Furthermore, I carried out research in other topics related to computer music, such as the use of the IEEE 1599 format (developed at Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale, Italy) for transcription and encoding of live performances in sub-symbolic formats (e.g. MIDI). I also applied this format to applications that aimed at the navigation of audio scenarios, new musical interfaces and streaming of multimedia contents over the web.

I have been member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Generated Music (TC CGM) and I am now a member of the IEEE WG1599: Working Group for XML Musical Application.

I served as peer reviewer for AES, CIM, CMMR, ICAD, ICMC, MMM, NIME, SIVE, and SMC conferences, I have been in the technical committee for ``XX CIM - Colloquio di Informatica Musicale'' conference.
I served as peer reviewer for journals such as: Journal of Software and Practices, IEEE TSLP, Journal of Multimedia Tools and Applications.

I was a co-organizer of the WIAMIS 2013 Special Session on: 3D reconstruction, coding and transmission for audiovisual interactive services and member of the scientific committee for the First Workshop on Multilayer Music Representation and Processing 2019 (MMRP).

I served as General Chair for the 18th Audio Mostly Conference (AM24), Scientific Chair for XXIV CIM - Colloquio di Informatica Musicale (2024), and the 18th Sound and Music Computing conference (SMC 2021).
